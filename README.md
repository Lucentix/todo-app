# Todo-App

## Description

The **Todo-App** is a simple application for managing tasks. With this app, you can add and delete tasks and keep track of your daily to-dos. It consists of a **Frontend** (React) and a **Backend** (Express) that manages the data. The goal of the app is to provide a lightweight, self-hosted solution for managing todos.

## Features

- **Frontend:**
  - Add new tasks
  - Delete tasks
  - Responsive design

- **Backend:**
  - Server for managing tasks (to be expanded later)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) here.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucentix/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

To install both frontend and backend dependencies, run the following command:

#### 2.1 Install backend and frontend dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 2.2 Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 3: Use the App

Once both the backend and frontend are successfully started, you can open the app in your web browser. The frontend is typically available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and the backend will run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (depending on the server settings).

### Step 4: Future Development

Currently, tasks are managed in the frontend, but the backend will be expanded in the future to store and persist tasks (e.g., in a database).

## Whatâ€™s Coming?

- **Data Persistence**: Currently, tasks are only stored in the frontend. In the future, a backend database (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL) will be integrated to store tasks permanently.
- **Authentication**: Users will be able to register and log in to manage their own to-do lists.
- **Improved Error Handling and Validation**: Future versions will include stronger error handling and validation to provide a better user experience.
- **Mobile Optimization**: The design will be further optimized to display better on mobile devices.
