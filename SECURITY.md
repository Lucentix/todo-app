## Security Best Practices

To improve the overall security of this project, follow these best practices:

1. **Keep Dependencies Up to Date**: 
   - This project uses various npm dependencies. Always ensure you are using the latest stable versions to avoid known security vulnerabilities.
   - Run `npm audit` regularly to check for security issues in dependencies.
   
2. **Review Permissions**: 
   - Make sure that the project does not include unnecessary permissions or features that could introduce security risks.

3. **Secure Code Practices**: 
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (such as passwords or API keys) in the code. Use environment variables or external secrets management services instead.

4. **Use HTTPS**:
   - If deploying this project to a production environment, ensure that your website uses HTTPS to protect data in transit.

5. **Use Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
